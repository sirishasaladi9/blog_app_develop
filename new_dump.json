Since the group members can't selectively delete the malicious message without opening the group window and re-triggering the crash-loop, they have to lose the entire group chat history, indefinitely, to get rid of it.

Most of these data leaks are because of malicious attacks, where exploitation of web application vulnerabilities is one of the most common cyber attack vectors.   An application security breach is a problem facing one and all, and no matter what's the size of your company, your web applications are prone to cyber attacks.   Hackers breach sites for a variety of reasons—some do it for fame, some to get competitive information, whereas some do it just for financial gains. No matter what the reason is, the cost of a security breach is always higher than the cost of protection, leading to loss of data, substantial financial losses, and most importantly, loss of customers' trust.

If there was a product or service you could buy that would just magically solve all of your cybersecurity problems, everyone would buy that thing, and we could all rest easy.   However, that is not the way it works. Technology continues to evolve. Cyber attackers adapt and develop new malicious tools and techniques, and cybersecurity vendors design creative new ways to detect and block those threats. Rinse and repeat.   Cybersecurity isn't easy, and there is no magic solution, but there are a handful of things you can do  that will greatly reduce your exposure to risk and significantly improve your security posture.   The right platform, intelligence, and expertise can help you avoid the vast majority of threats, and help you detect and respond more quickly to the attacks that get through.

The company today released its monthly security updates to address two critical arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities—one in Adobe Photoshop CC and another in Adobe Digital Editions.   Upon successful exploitation, both critical vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user and take control of an affected system.   However, the good news is that the company found no evidence of any exploits in the wild for these security issues, Adobe said.   The vulnerability in Adobe Photoshop CC , discovered by Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative and assigned CVE-2019-7094, is a heap corruption issue which affects Photoshop CC 19.1.7 and earlier 19.x versions as well as Photoshop CC 20.0.2 and earlier 20.x versions for Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS operating systems.

Security researchers at antivirus firm Trend Micro have discovered a novel way hackers are using in the wild to bypass Apple's macOS security protection and infect Mac computers by deploying malicious EXE files that normally run only on Windows computers.   Researchers found several samples of malicious macOS application (.dmg) masquerading as installers for popular software on a torrent site that includes an EXE application compiled with Mono framework to make it compatible with macOS.   Mono is an open source implementation of Microsoft's .NET Framework that allows developers to create cross-platform .NET applications, which work across all supported platforms, including Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.

Instead, Epic Games software development company has confirmed the Fortnite APK for Android  will be available for download exclusively only through its official website, bypassing the Google Play Store.    Why Fortnite for Android Bypassing Google Play Store?   Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney cites two main reasons for this decision.   First, offering Fortnite APK downloads directly from its official website will allow the company to \"have a direct relationship\" with its consumers.   Second, since Google takes a 30 percent cut of revenue each time a user makes an in-app purchase through its Play Store, the decision will allow the company to save millions.
